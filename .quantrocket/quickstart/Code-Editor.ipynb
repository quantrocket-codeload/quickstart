    "JupyterLab is an excellent platform for doing interactive research in notebooks or terminals, but it is not ideal for writing Python code outside of a notebook because it only provides a basic text editor that lacks code completion and error checking. For a better user experience when writing Python scripts and strategy files, you can switch over to the Eclipse Theia Code Editor. These are complementary tools that provide different windows on the same filesystem - just like using two different editors on your desktop."
