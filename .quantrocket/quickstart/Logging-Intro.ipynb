    "Many QuantRocket tasks run in the background and emit log messages to keep you informed about what they're doing. Log messages are handled by the `flightlog` service. The `flightlog` service provides two levels of logging: higher-level summary log messages and lower-level, detailed logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use JupyterLab terminals to monitor the log messages. Because the logs are an important source of feedback, it's a good idea to open two terminals each time you use QuantRocket, one for the standard logs and one for the detailed logs. There is a Flightlog button on the Launcher menu to make this easier. The button simply opens two terminals and automatically types the command to stream the logs (`quantrocket flightlog stream` and `quantrocket flightlog stream --detail`, respectively). You can then drag the terminals to a convenient place in your JupyterLab work area.\n",
