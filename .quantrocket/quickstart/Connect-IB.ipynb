    "QuantRocket uses the IB API to collect market data from IB, submit orders, and track positions and account balances. All communication with IB is routed through IB Gateway, a Java application which is a slimmed-down version of Trader Workstation (TWS) intended for API use. IB Gateway runs inside the `ibg1` container and connects to IB using your IB username and password. The `launchpad` container provides an API that allows you to start and stop IB Gateway inside the `ibg` container(s)."
